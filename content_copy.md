## Why This Program (Parallax Narrative)
_Subtle gradient background with slow parallax drift; each stanza fades in on scroll. No clip-art—use refined typography + animated underlines._

1. **Pain — Fundraising alone is costly.**
   - Months of rejections, playbooks built for Silicon Valley, and runway burned chasing first meetings instead of shipping.
2. **Solution — A builder-led playbook.**
   - Six weeks with the operators behind Rappi, tactical office hours to pressure-test your deck, and a peer circle trading investor intel in real time.
3. **Outcome — Investor-ready in weeks.**
   - Leave with a story investors buy, warm paths into tier-1 funds, and momentum to grow while the round comes together.

## What You’ll Master (Skill Grid)
_Format: minimal cards; hover/expand reveals format details (live session, workshop, office hours)._

1. **Story investors buy**
   - Align vision, traction, and ambition for a narrative that resonates across global and LATAM funds.
2. **Targeting the right funds**
   - Map warm paths, investor mandates, and timing before the first call so every meeting compounds.
3. **Data room readiness**
   - Assemble diligence-proof metrics, ops dashboards, and financials that answer questions before they’re asked.
4. **Closing confidently**
   - Rehearse terms, communication cadences, and follow-up so you can negotiate while keeping the company running.
