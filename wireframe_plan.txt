Fundraising School Website Refresh
Drafted: 2025-10-24

1. Objectives
- Convert English-speaking tech founders who are actively raising capital by rapidly proving credibility, clarity, and differentiated value versus other fundraising programs.
- Broadcast Andrés Bilbao's founder-first ethos through consistent visual language, founder narratives, and trust cues shared with 30x.org.
- Reduce friction in the application journey by previewing Airtable requirements, setting expectations, and reinforcing support touchpoints.
- Leverage social proof (testimonials, metrics, alumni stories) to neutralize skepticism about a free program and inspire action.
- Create reciprocal traffic loops between Fundraising School and 30x.org without blurring each program's target audience.

2. Guiding Principles
- Founder-Led Storytelling: Lead with Andrés Bilbao and Laura Gaviria Halaby to anchor authenticity and expertise.
- Proof Before Pitch: Every major content block accompanies evidence (metrics, quotes, recognizable logos) before requesting action.
- Clarity and Momentum: Short, scannable sections with progressive disclosure that keep the Apply CTA visible and contextual.
- Shared Brand System: Typography, color accents, iconography, and illustration styles mirror a unified Andrés Bilbao brand used on both Fundraising School and 30x.org.
- Intentional Cross-Pollination: Introduce targeted cross-links that help founders discover 30x.org (and vice versa) while making it easy to self-select into the right program.
- Accessibility and Inclusivity: Design components with accessible contrast, semantic structure, and clear microcopy for global English-speaking founders.

3. Wireframe Outline (Desktop-first)
- Global Header
  * Left: shared wordmark (responsive lockup) linking home; matches 30x.org typography/colors.
  * Center nav: About, Program, Speakers, Success Stories, FAQ, Apply.
  * Right: "30x.org" pill link (secondary style) plus primary Apply button; sticky behavior on scroll with subtle shadow.
- Hero (fold)
  * Split layout: left column headline "Raise capital with the builders behind Rappi" supported by subhead clarifying 6-week, founder-led format; right column features portraits of Andrés and Laura with pull-quote overlay.
  * Key proof bar (inline): "Backed founders have raised $X across Y countries" + logos carousel (3-4) to reinforce immediacy.
  * Primary CTA "Start Your Application" with microcopy "Takes ~5 minutes • Selected founders unlock $50K+ in perks" linking to requirements modal.
  * Secondary link to learn about 30x.org for corporate leaders (drives cross-traffic without confusing hero action).
- Application Preview Modal (triggered from hero CTA)
  * Two-column checklist summarizing Airtable fields; highlights need for deck, ARR band, and privacy acknowledgment; includes optional download/print PDF.
- Why Fundraising School (parallax narrative)
  * Full-width scroll block with subtle parallax background gradients; each stanza fades in: Pain → Solution → Outcomes.
  * Pain: "Fundraising alone is costly" (rejection fatigue, generic playbooks, lost runway) presented as elegant three-line copy with slim divider.
  * Solution: "Builder-led playbook" (6-week live sessions, tactical office hours, curated peer network) revealed as user scrolls.
  * Outcomes: "Investor-ready in weeks" (narrative clarity, warm investor paths, momentum to keep building) capped with contextual CTA "See what you'll master".
  * Replace heavy icons with refined typographic markers or line art accents animated on scroll.
- Success Proof Strip
  * Full-width slider with combined testimonial + metric: alumni headshot, quote, outcome (e.g., "$8M Series A closed"), investor logos.
  * CTA to "Read Alumni Stories" linking to dedicated case study page.
- What You'll Master
  * Minimal grid or stacked cards outlining core skill gains: Story investors buy, Targeting the right funds, Data room readiness, Closing confidently.
  * Each card pairs one-line promise with supporting microcopy and an optional hover/expand for the related live session format.
  * Secondary CTA "Get the detailed syllabus" gated by email (optional) for lead capture.
- Founders & Faculty
  * Tabbed interface (Founders, Speakers, Mentors) to reduce vertical scroll; each tab highlights 4-6 featured profiles with "View all" link.
  * Callout card linking to 30x.org featuring overlapping mentor/faculty to communicate ecosystem.

- FAQ Accordions
  * Grouped by theme (Eligibility, Commitment, Support, Privacy) with inline contact form for additional questions.
- Cross-Program CTA
  * Banner near footer: "Scaling a corporate innovation team? Explore 30x.org" with matching design; reciprocal asset on 30x.org should invite founders to Fundraising School.
- Footer
  * Shared layout with 30x.org: logo, quick links, social handles, newsletter signup, privacy link, and secondary "Apply" CTA.

Mobile considerations
- Header collapses into hamburger with persistent Apply button.
- Hero stack portrait below copy with swipeable testimonials.
- Tabs convert to horizontal scroll chips for Faculty section.
- Timeline compresses into accordion by week with sticky "Apply" button at bottom.

  3. Proof: Showcase alumni wins, testimonials, and investor partnerships before asking visitors to apply.
  4. Clarity: Outline the application process, time commitment, and support structure to reduce uncertainty.
  5. Action: Keep Apply CTA persistent and contextual, reminding applicants of limited seats and dates.
- Tone and Voice

5. Cross-Program Synergy Tactics
- Shared Visual Language: align typography, button styles, and color accents across both sites; introduce "Andrés Bilbao Ecosystem" badge used in headers or footers.
- Reciprocal CTAs: Fundraising School footer/banner links to 30x.org for corporate teams, while 30x.org includes "Need fundraising help?" link back.
- Storytelling Bridge: Create a narrative block explaining how the same team supports founders and executives, highlighting complementary outcomes.
- Content Hubs: Plan future blog or resource hub that surfaces case studies relevant to both audiences with segmented CTAs.
- Tracking & Analytics: Tag cross-site links with UTM parameters to measure traffic lift and conversions attributable to synergy efforts.

  * Alumni testimonials (video and text) plus performance metrics.
  * Partner logos in vector format and perk value details.
  * Updated brand guidelines or palette references (pending from stakeholder).
  * Airtable form screenshots or schema for building preview modal.
- Experience Validation
