# Fundraising School Website Refresh – Key Improvements

This document contrasts the original fundraising-school.com experience with the new monoscroll concept delivered in this repository.

## 1. Narrative & Hero
- **Original:** Generic headline with minimal founder presence; call-to-action (CTA) lacked context.
- **Refresh:** Prominent hero that spotlights Andrés Bilbao and Laura Gaviria Halaby with portraits, quote, proof bar, and CTA microcopy that sets expectations (time to apply, perks unlocked).

## 2. Storytelling Flow
- **Original:** Dense text blocks; speakers list dominated scroll; limited emotional journey.
- **Refresh:** Introduces a three-frame “Why this program” narrative (Pain → Solution → Outcome) with parallax motion to guide readers, improving comprehension and scannability.

## 3. Curriculum Clarity
- **Original:** Static curriculum image; unclear modules/outcomes.
- **Refresh:** “What you’ll master” grid outlines four core skill pillars with supporting details and hover states, replacing the inaccessible image.

## 4. Social Proof & Outcomes
- **Original:** Relied primarily on partner logos; testimonials absent.
- **Refresh:** Testimonial slider featuring alumni quotes, metrics, and investor logos, plus proof stats surfaced near the hero.

## 5. Mentors & Faculty
- **Original:** Long speaker grid causing scroll fatigue and visual repetition.
- **Refresh:** Tabbed interface segments Founders, Speakers, and Mentors, maintaining focus and adding ecosystem cross-link to 30x.org.

## 6. Community & Perks
- **Original:** Perks and post-program value lightly described.
- **Refresh:** Dedicated “Curated value” section quantifies benefits (e.g., partner perk dollar amounts, response times) and reiterates exclusivity.

## 7. Application Journey & Trust
- **Original:** CTA led straight to the form without expectation setting.
- **Refresh:** Four-step journey (Apply → Selection convo → Cohort kickoff → Alumni hub) plus expanded FAQ and inline contact form to address objections.

## 8. Brand Alignment
- **Original:** Limited connection to 30X ecosystem.
- **Refresh:** Shared typography (Archivo/Inter), palette derived from 30X brand files, cross-program banner, and ecosystem badge reinforcing Andrés Bilbao’s network.

## 9. Motion & Interactivity
- **Original:** Static sections with minimal interaction.
- **Refresh:** Scroll-triggered reveals, parallax background, testimonial auto-play with manual controls, accessible accordion FAQ, and tab panels to keep the experience dynamic while honoring reduced-motion preferences.

## 10. Technical Quality
- **Original:** No dedicated dev tooling in repo snapshot.
- **Refresh:** Site upgraded to a Next.js app (`npm run dev`) with modular asset handling, client-side interactions encapsulated in React hooks, and production-ready build/start scripts.

Together, these changes elevate the storytelling, improve conversion cues, and connect Fundraising School to the broader 30X brand system envisioned in the project brief.
